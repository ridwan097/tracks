# Track app server

This is the react native app for the track server applciaiton I made through the udemy course I am followin

## To run:

npm install

npm start

## To run with server:

run ngrok 3000

3000 is an example. This would be the port that the server is running.

After this, past the first, left forwarding link into the tracker.js file as baseUrl

You are good to go 👍🏾
